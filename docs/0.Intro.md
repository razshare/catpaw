# Get started

In order to get started you will need [php 8.0](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) or a more recent version.

All you need to do is create a new project using the starter template.

```bash
composer create-project razshare/catpaw-starter
```

Or you could also clone the template from https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw-starter

---

After you've created your new project, you can run it in development mode using
```bash
compsoer run dev
```
or in production using
```bash
compsoer run start
```
after that's done, your server will be up and running on port ```8080```.

This project is aimed at linux distributions and has not been tested properly on Windows or Mac machines.
