# Web Route Handlers

Route handlers are functions that trigger whenever a user requests a specific resource.<br/>
You can map different handlers to different http paths and methods.

Before adding any route handlers you'll need to start the web server.<br/>
You can start it by invoking `\CatPaw\Web\Server::create()->start()`

```php
<?php

function main(){
    \CatPaw\Web\Server::create()->start();
}

```

## GET

You can use the ```CatPaw\Web\Router``` class in order to add a route handler.<br />

We'll create a route handler for ```GET /cats``` and respond with <b>"there are no cats here"</b>.

```php
<?php

use CatPaw\Web\Server;
use CatPaw\Web\Router;

function main(){
    Route::get("/cats", function() {
        return "there are no cats here";
    });
    Server::create()->start();
}

```
<br/>

## POST

Let's add some cats to our server, we'll need a POST handler for that.

In order to add a POST route handler we'll use ```CatPaw\Web\Router::post```.

```php
<?php

use CatPaw\Web\Server;
use CatPaw\Web\Router;

function main() {
    
    //...

    Route::post("/cats", function() {
        // todo
    });

    Server::create()->start();
}
```

We now need some sort of variable to save our cats to.<br/>
We'll simply create a `$cats` variable in the outer scope of the handler which will act as our session object.

```php
<?php

use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Body;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Consumes;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Body;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Produces;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Server;
use CatPaw\Web\Router;

function main() {
    $cats = [];

    Route::get(
        path    : "/cats",
        callback:
        #[Produces("application/json")]
        function() use (&$cats) {
            return $cats;
        }
    );

    Route::post(
        path    : "/cats",
        callback:
        #[Consumes("application/json")]
        function(
            #[Body] 
            array $cat
        ) use(&$cats) {
            $cats[] = $cat;
        }
    );

    Server::create()->start();
}
```

And that's how you save cats in CatPaw!
