# Web Route Handlers

Route handlers are functions that trigger whenever a user requests a specific resource.<br/>
You can map different handlers to different http paths and methods.

## GET

You can use the ```CatPaw\Tools\Helpers\Route``` class in order to add a route handler.<br />

We'll create a listener on ```GET /cats``` endpoint and respond with <b>"there are no cats here"</b>.
```php
<?php

namespace {

	use CatPaw\CatPaw;
	use CatPaw\Tools\Helpers\Route;
	use CatPaw\Attributes\StartWebServer;

    #[StartWebServer]
	function main(){
		Route::get("/cats", function() {
			return "there are no cats here";
		});
	}
}
```
<br/>

## POST

Let's add some cats to our server, we'll need a POST endpoint for that.

In order to add a POST event listener we'll use the same class as before, like so:

```php
<?php

namespace {
    
    use CatPaw\CatPaw;
    use CatPaw\Tools\Helpers\Route;
	use CatPaw\Attributes\StartWebServer;

    #[StartWebServer]
    function main() {
        
        //...

        Route::post("/cats", function() {
            // todo
        });

    }
}
```

We now need some sort of variable to save our cats to. We'll simply add a global variable that will act as our session
object.

```php
<?php

namespace {

	use CatPaw\Attributes\Body;
	use CatPaw\Attributes\Consumes;
	use CatPaw\Attributes\Http\RequestBody;
	use CatPaw\Attributes\Produces;
	use CatPaw\CatPaw;
	use CatPaw\Configs\MainConfiguration;
	use CatPaw\Tools\Helpers\Route;
	use CatPaw\Attributes\StartWebServer;

    #[StartWebServer]

	function main() {
		$cats = [];

		Route::get(
			path    : "/cats",
			callback:
			#[Produces("application/json")]
			function() use ($cats) {
				return $cats;
			}
		);

		Route::post(
			path    : "/cats",
			callback:
			#[Consumes("application/json")]
			function(
				#[RequestBody] 
				array $cat
			) use(&$cats) {
				$cats[] = $cat;
			}
		);

	}
}
```

And that's how you save cats in CatPaw!

<br />

## NOTE

All event paths **MUST** start with "/".

Some event paths may start with "@" instead, those are special events which have specific meanings within the scope of
the application.<br />
One such path is "[@404](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw-template/wiki/A.3.0-Not-Found)".
