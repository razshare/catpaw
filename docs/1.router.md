# Router

Routes are defined through route handlers.

Route handlers are functions that trigger whenever a user requests a specific resource.<br/>
You can map different handlers to different http paths and methods.

Before adding any route handlers you'll need to start the web server.<br/>
You can start it with `CatPaw\Web\Server::create::start`

```php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->start()->await(),
    );
}
```

## GET

You can use ```CatPaw\Web\Router::get(string, callable)``` in order to add a route handler.<br />

We'll create a route handler for ```GET /cats``` and respond with <b>"there are no cats here"</b>.

```php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->router->get('/cats', static function(){
            return 'there are no cats here';
        }),
        $server->value->start()->await(),
    );
}
```


> [!NOTE]
> All event paths **MUST** start with `/`.


## POST

Let's add some cats to our server, we'll need a POST handler for that.

In order to add a POST route handler we'll use ```CatPaw\Web\Router::post```.

```php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->router->post(
            path: '/cats',
            callback: static function() {
                // todo
            }
        ),
        $server->value->start()->await(),
    );
}
```

We now need some sort of variable to save our cats to.<br/>
We'll simply create a `$cats` variable in the outer scope of the handler which will act as our session object.

```php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Body;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Consumes;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Produces;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main(): Unsafe {
    $cats = [];
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->router->get(
            path    : '/cats',
            callback:
            #[Produces('array', 'application/json')]
            static function() use (&$cats) {
                return $cats;
            }
        ),
        $server->value->router->post(
            path    : '/cats',
            callback:
            #[Consumes('object', 'application/json')]
            static function(#[Body] array $cat) use (&$cats) {
                $cats[] = $cat;
            }
        ),
        $server->value->start()->await()
    );
}
```

And that's how you save cats in CatPaw!

# Filesystem routes

You can automate route handler definitions by describing your routes through the filesystem instead of programmatically invoking `CatPaw\Web\Router::[method]`.
 

1. Create a new `server/api` directory
   ```shell
   mkdir -p server/api
   ```
2. Scan the directory by passing in the `api` parameter to `CatPaw\Web\Server::create`.
    ```php
    use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
    use CatPaw\Web\Server;
    use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
    
    function main(): Unsafe {
        return anyError(
            $server = Server::create(api: 'server/api'),
            $server->value->start()->await(),
        );
    }
    ```
   > You can add a prefix to all your routes with the `apiPrexif` property.
   > ```php
   > Server::create(api:'server/api', apiPrefix:'/v1')
   > ```

### How to define a route using the file system

Create a file `server/api/get.php`, this file should return a function.
```php
return static function(){
    return "hello world";
};
```

That's it, you just created a route handler that serves requests at `GET /`.

- The route handler function can inject any of the dependencies that a normal route handler would, including path parameters, sessions, produced and consumed content etc.<br/>
  That is because, under the hood, the resulting function is actually used to create a normal route handler, which means that the OpenAPI service will detect these routes and automatically document them for you.

- The file name should always be `[METHOD].php` where `[METHOD]` is an http method.<br/>
  This way the scanner is able to infer the http method to use when exposing the function you're returning.

- The route path will match the location of your file relative to `server/api`, in this case `/`.

This means that, in this case, the scanner will automatically pick up the function and use it to map a route handler for `GET /`, which when called will return the string `hello world` as `text/plain`.

The equivalent route handler definition would be:

```php
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->router->get('/', static function(){
            return 'hello world';
        }),
        $server->value->start()->await(),
    );
}
```

### Using path parameters

Create a new file `server/api/about/{username}/get.php`.

```php
return static function(string $username) {
    return "this is $username's about page.";
}
```

- Path parameters are automatically linked to function parameters when their names match.\
  In this case `string $username` matches `{username}` so its value will be inferred.
- You can further customize your path parameters using `CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Param`.
  ```php
  use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Param;
  
  return static function(#[Param('\w{3,15}')] string $username) {
      return "this is $username's about page.";
  };
  ```
  In this example `$username` must be at least 3 and at most 15 characters long.\
  If the criteria is not met, then the server will skip the route handler and potentially respond with a `404 Not Found`.
   [!NOTE]
  > This behaviour may change in the future.\
  > The server could potentially respond with 400 Bad Request instead.
  
  > You can read more about path parameters [here](./2.path-parameters.md).

The equivalent programmatic definition is as follows

```php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->router->get(
            path: '/about/{username}',
            callback: static function(string $username) {
                return  "this is $username's about page.";
            }
        ),
        $server->value->start()->await(),
    );
}
```
