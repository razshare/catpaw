# Router

Routes are defined through route handlers.

Route handlers are functions that trigger whenever a user requests a specific resource.\
You can map different handlers to different http paths and methods.

Before adding any route handlers you'll need to start the web server.

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main(): Unsafe {
    return Server::get()->start();
}
```

## GET

You can create routes through
```php
$server->router->get('/path', handler(...));
```

Here's a complete example

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use function CatPaw\Core\success;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function handler() {
    return success('there are no cats here');
}

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(function() {
        $server = Server::get();
        $server->router->get('/cats', handler(...))->try();
        $server->start()->try();
    });
}
```

This creates a _GET /cats_ route which responds with _"there are no cats here"_.

> [!NOTE]
> All paths _MUST_ start with `/`.

## POST

Similarly to the _GET_ example, the following

```php
$server->router->post('/cats', handler(...))
```
will create a **POST** route.

A more complete example would be

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\anyError;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Body;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Consumes;
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Produces;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

#[Consumes(
    contentType: 'text/plain',
    schema: 'string',
    example: 'hello world'
)]
#[Produces(
    status: 200,
    contentType: 'text/plain',
    description: 'On success',
    className: 'string',
)]
function handler(#[Body] string $body){
    echo "Received body: $body\n";
}

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(function(){
        $server = Server::get();
        $server->router->post('/cats', handler(...))->try();
        $server->start()->try();
    });
}
```

# Filesystem routes

You can automate routes definitions by describing them through the filesystem instead of programmatically defining them.

Create a new _src/api_ directory
```shell
mkdir -p src/api
```
Scan the directory using `::withApiLocation()`
```php
Server::get()->withApiLocation('src/api');
```
> [!NOTE]
> You can add a prefix to all your api routes using `::withApiPrefix()`.
> ```php
> Server::get()->withApiLocation('src/api')->withApiPrefix('api');
> ```

Create a file _src/api/get.php_, this file should return a function.

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\success;
return function(){
    return success("hello world");
};
```

This file will serve requests for _GET /_.

> That is because, under the hood, the resulting function is actually

The equivalent programmatic route definition is

```php
$server->router->get('/', fn () => 'hello world');
```

### Path parameters

Create a new file _src/api/about/{username}/get.php_

```sh
mkdir -p src/api/about/{username}/get.php
```

Path parameters are automatically linked to function parameters when their names match, so in this case you can inject **$username**.
```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\success;
return function(string $username) {
    return success("this is $username's about page.");
}
```

You can further customize your path parameters using _#[Param]_.
```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Param;

return function(#[Param('\w{3,15}')] string $username) {
  return success("this is $username's about page.");
};
```
In this example **$username** must be at least 3 and at most 15 characters long.\
If the criteria is not met, then the server will skip the route handler and potentially respond with
a _404 Not Found_.

> [!NOTE]
> You can read more about path parameters [here](./2.path-parameters.md).

The equivalent programmatic definition is

```php
$server->router->get('/about/{username}', handler(...));
```
