# RaspberryPI

You can interract with your RaspberryPI's GPIO interface by injecting dependencies through the `\CatPaw\RaspberryPI\Attribute\GPIO` attribute.<br/>
The attribute constructor takes 2 arguments:

1. The pin number, a string that can have one of the following values: `7`,`11`,`12`,`13rv1`,`13`,`13rv2`,`15`,`16`,`18`,`22`.<br/>
Pin `13` is an alias for `13rv2`, meaning internaly its index is resolved to `27`.

    As you can see they're named following the pins' indexing as show in this schema:

    This way you can phisically count the pins' position if you don't have the schema around and don't remember it.
2. Read/write flag ('`read`' / '`write`')

Here's an example of a blinking led on pin `12`<br/>

```php
use CatPaw\RaspberryPI\Attributes\GPIO;
use function Amp\delay;

function main(
    #[GPIO('12','write')]
    $set12
){
    $led = false;
    while(true){
        yield delay(1000);
        $led = !$led;
        yield $set12($led);
    }
}
```

Result:<br/>
