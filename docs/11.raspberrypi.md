# RaspberryPi

You can interact with your RaspberryPi's Gpio interface through `\CatPaw\Core\RaspberryPi\GPIOService`.<br/>

The service provides two methods: `GpioService::createReader(string):callable`
and `GpioService::createWriter(string):callable`.

Both take one argument, the pin.

The pin is a string that can have one of the following
values: `7`,`11`,`12`,`13rv1`,`13`,`13rv2`,`15`,`16`,`18`,`22`.<br/>
Pin `13` is an alias for `13rv2`, meaning internally its index is resolved to `27`.

    As you can see they're named following the pins' indexing as show in this schema:

    This way you can physically count the pins' position if you don't have the schema around and don't remember it.

Here's an example of a blinking LED on pin `12`<br/>

```php
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use function Amp\delay;
use function CatPaw\Core\error;
use function CatPaw\Core\stop;
use CatPaw\Core\RaspberryPi\Services\GpioService;

function main(GpioService $gpio): Unsafe {
    $writer = $gpio->createWriter('12');
    $active = true;
    while (true) {
        $writer->write($active?'1':'0')->try($error) or stop($error);
        $active = !$active;
        delay(1);
    }
}
```

Result:<br/>
