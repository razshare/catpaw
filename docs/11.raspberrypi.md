# RaspberryPI

You can interact with your RaspberryPI's GPIO interface through `\CatPaw\Core\RaspberryPI\GPIOService`.<br/>

The service provides two methods: `GPIOService::createReader(string):callable` and `GPIOService::createWriter(string):callable`.

Both take one argument, the pin.

The pin is a string that can have one of the following values: `7`,`11`,`12`,`13rv1`,`13`,`13rv2`,`15`,`16`,`18`,`22`.<br/>
Pin `13` is an alias for `13rv2`, meaning internally its index is resolved to `27`.

    As you can see they're named following the pins' indexing as show in this schema:

    This way you can phisically count the pins' position if you don't have the schema around and don't remember it.

Here's an example of a blinking LED on pin `12`<br/>

```php
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use function Amp\delay;
use function CatPaw\Core\error;
use CatPaw\Core\RaspberryPI\Services\GPIOService;

function main(GPIOService $gpio): Unsafe {
    $writer = $gpio->createWriter('12');
    $active = true;
    while (true) {
        if ($error = $writer->write($active?'1':'0')->error) {
            return error($error);
        }
        $active = !$active;
        delay(1);
    }
}
```

Result:<br/>
