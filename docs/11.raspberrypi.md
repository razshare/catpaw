# RaspberryPI

You can interract with your RaspberryPI's GPIO interface through `\CatPaw\RaspberryPI\GPIOService`.<br/>

The service provides two methods: `GPIOService::createReader` and `GPIOService::createWriter`.

Both take one argument, the pin number.

The pin number is a string that can have one of the following values: `7`,`11`,`12`,`13rv1`,`13`,`13rv2`,`15`,`16`,`18`,`22`.<br/>
Pin `13` is an alias for `13rv2`, meaning internaly its index is resolved to `27`.

    As you can see they're named following the pins' indexing as show in this schema:

    This way you can phisically count the pins' position if you don't have the schema around and don't remember it.

Here's an example of a blinking led on pin `12`<br/>

```php

use function Amp\delay;

use CatPaw\RaspberryPI\Services\GPIOService;

function main( GPIOService $gpio ){
    $writer = $gpio->createWriter('12');
    $active = true;
    while (true) {
        $writer->write($active?'1':'0');
        $active = !$active;
        delay(1);
    }
}
```
