# Stores

Stores are observable objects that contain a value.

Each store has a `subscribe(Closure $callback)` method which allows the execution of a `Closure` whenever the value of the store changes, this closure provides the new value of the store as an parameter.

Stores can be of 2 types:

- Readable stores
- Writable stores


Both stores implement the `subscribe` and `get` methods, but only the `Writable` store implements the `set` method.

# Writable

A writable store's value can be set on creation or some time after using the `set` method.

 ```php
 namespace {
	use function CatPaw\Store\writable;

    function main() {
      $store = writable("A");       //set on creation
      echo $store->get().PHP_EOL;   //will print "A"
      $store->set("B");             //changing the value
      echo $store->get().PHP_EOL;   //will print "B"
    }
}
 ```
 
 As mentioned above stores provide a `subscribe` method.<br/>
 This method makes it possible to watch over the value of the store.<br/>
 Once called, the `subscribe` method will return itself a function, which when called will cancel the store subscription.
 
  ```php
 namespace {
	use function CatPaw\Store\writable;

    function main() {
      $store = writable("A");
      $unsubscribe = $store->subscribe(function($value){
        echo $value.PHP_EOL;  //this will print twice, once the default value "A", then "B" when it changes.
      });
      $store->set("B");
      
      //now we don't want to watch the store anymore, it's time to unsubscribe from it.
      $unsubscribe();
      
      $store->set("C");
    }
}
 ```
 The above code will print 
 ```
 A
 B
 ```
 to the console.<br/>
 It won't print `C` because by the time `C` is set, the anonymous function has already been unsubscribed from the store.
 
# Readable

A readable store is very similar to a writable store.<br/>
Two things differentiate a readable store from a writable one:

1. A readable store does not offer a public `set` method.
2. A readable store requires a start `Closure` when created, this `Closure` will be invoked when the first subscriber subscribes to the store.<br/>
   The start `Closure` takes  `1 parameter` and must `return a function`.<br/>
      - The `parameter` is a `$set` function which can be used to set the store's value.<br/>
      - The `returned function` will be invoked when the last subscriber unsubscribes from the store.

 ```php
namespace {
use function CatPaw\Store\readable;

  function main() {
    $store = readable("default",function($set){
      \Amp\call(function(){
        //do some async stuff perhaps query a db, let's say t takes 2-3 seconds
      }).onResolve(function($asyncValye){
        $set($asyncValue);
        echo "new value set: $asyncValue".PHP_EOL;
      })
    });
		
    $store->subscribe(function($value){
      echo "new value received: $value".PHP_EOL;
    });
  }
}
 ```
