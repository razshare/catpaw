# Stores

Stores are observable objects that contain a value.

Each store has a `subscribe(callable $callback)` method which allows the execution of a `callable` whenever the value of the store changes, this callable provides the new value of the store as a parameter.

Stores can be of 2 types:

- Readable stores
- Writable stores


Both stores implement the `subscribe` and `get` methods, but only the `Writable` store implements the `set` method.

# Writable

A writable store's value can be set on creation or some time after by using the `set` method.

```php
use function CatPaw\Store\writable;

function main() {
    $store = writable("A");       //set on creation
    echo $store->get().PHP_EOL;   //will print "A"
    $store->set("B");             //changing the value
    echo $store->get().PHP_EOL;   //will print "B"
}
```
 
 As mentioned above stores provide a `subscribe` method.<br/>
 This method makes it possible to watch over the value of the store.<br/>
 Once called, the `subscribe` method will return itself a function, which when called will cancel the store subscription.
 
```php
use function CatPaw\Store\writable;

function main() {
    $store = writable("A");
    $unsubscribe = $store->subscribe(function($value){
        //you can execute async code here
        echo $value.PHP_EOL;
    });
    $store->set("B");

    //now we don't want to watch the store anymore, it's time to unsubscribe from it.
    $unsubscribe();

    $store->set("C");
}
```
The above code will print 
```
A
B
```
to the console.<br/>
It won't print `C` because by the time `C` is set `$unsubscribe()` has already been invoked.
 
# Readable

A readable store is very similar to a writable store.<br/>
Two things differentiate a readable store from a writable one:

1. A readable store does not offer a public `set` method.
2. A readable store requires a start `callable` when created, this `callable` will be invoked when the first subscriber subscribes to the store.<br/>
   The start `callable` takes  `1 parameter` and *should* `return a function`.<br/>
      - The `parameter` is a `$set` function which can be used to set the store's value.<br/>
      - The `returned function` will be invoked when the last subscriber unsubscribes from the store.

```php
use function CatPaw\Store\readable;
use function CatPaw\Store\writable;

function main() {
    $unsubscribers = [];

    $counter = writable(0);

    $unsubscribeAll = function() use (&$unsubscribers) {
        foreach ($unsubscribers as $unsubscribe) {
            $unsubscribe();
        }
    };

    $store = readable("default", function($set) {
        //you can execute async code here
        $set("hello world");
        return function() {
            echo "All subscribers have unsubscribed\n";
        };
    });

    $unsubscribers[] = $store->subscribe(function($value) use (&$counter) {
        //you can execute async code here
        $counter->set($counter->get() + 1);
        echo "new value received: $value".PHP_EOL;
    });

    $unsubscribers[] = $store->subscribe(function($value) use (&$counter) {
        //you can execute async code here
        $counter->set($counter->get() + 1);
        echo "new value received: $value".PHP_EOL;
    });

    $unsubscribers[] = $store->subscribe(function($value) use (&$counter) {
        //you can execute async code here
        $counter->set($counter->get() + 1);
        echo "new value received: $value".PHP_EOL;
    });

    $counter->subscribe(fn ($counter) => $counter >= 6?$unsubscribeAll():false);
}
```

this code will output

```sh
new value received: default
new value received: default
new value received: default
new value received: hello world
new value received: hello world
new value received: hello world
All subscribers have unsubscribed
```
