# Services


A class annotated with the `\CatPaw\Attributes\Service` attribute is a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) which benefits from dependency injections.


Services are the building blocks of `catpaw-core`, whenever possible, classes should be converted into services, requiring their dependencies through the `__construct` method.


The following are 2 bare services and a 3rd one requiring them.

```php
namespace App;

use Catpaw\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceA {
    public function myMethod():bool{
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App;

use Catpaw\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceB {
    public function myMethod():bool{
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App;

use Catpaw\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceC {
    public function _construct(
        private ServiceA $serviceA,
        private ServiceB $serviceA,
    ){}

    public function doSomething():bool{
        if($this->serviceA())
            return $this->serviceB();

        return false;
    }
}
```

## Note

Services (and singletons) are detected and loaded through `\CatPaw\Container::load`.

If you're using the default `vendor/catpaw/scripts/start.php` startup script everything is handled for you automatically, no need for any setup.

If instead you don't want to use the default startup script you will need to call `\CatPaw\Container::load` yourself.<br/>
Here's an example:<br/>

```php
\Amp\Loop::run(function(){   //start the AMP event loop
    /**
     *  $scannedDirectories will contain a list of all the directories that have been scanned.
     */
    $scannedDirectories = yield \CatPaw\Utilities\Container::load("./composer.json");


    // From this point on you can inject services like so:
    yield \CatPaw\Utilities\Container::run(function(MyService $service){
        $service->todo();
    });
});

```
