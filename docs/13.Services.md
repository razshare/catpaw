# Services


A class annotated with the `\CatPaw\Attributes\Service` attribute is a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) which benefits from dependency injections.


Services are the building blocks of `catpaw-core`, whenever possible, classes should be converted into services, requiring their dependencies through the `__construct` method.


The following are 2 bare services and a 3rd one requiring them.

```php
namespace App;

use Catpaw\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceA {
    public function myMethod():bool{
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App;

use Catpaw\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceB {
    public function myMethod():bool{
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App;

use Catpaw\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceC {
    public function _construct(
        private ServiceA $serviceA,
        private ServiceB $serviceA,
    ){}

    public function doSomething():bool{
        if($this->serviceA())
            return $this->serviceB();

        return false;
    }
}
```
