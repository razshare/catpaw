# Container

You can use the dependencies container to get, set (singletons) and provide dependencies.

# Getting a dependency

You can use `Container::get()` to get a dependency by name.

Although it is technically not required, it's good practice to name and provide your dependency using an interface.

You have some dependencies already setup out of the box, for example the logger.

```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Container;
use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;

$logger = Container::get(LoggerInterface::class)->unwrap($error);
```

# Setting a dependency

You can set a singleton instance of a dependency using `Container::set()`.

```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Container;
use Amp\Http\Client\HttpClient;
use Amp\Http\Client\HttpClientBuilder;

Container::set(HttpClient::class, HttpClientBuilder::buildDefault());
```

# Providing a dependency

If you want to provide new instances of a dependency, you can use `Container::provide()` instead.

```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Container;
use Amp\Http\Client\HttpClient;
use Amp\Http\Client\HttpClientBuilder;

Container::provide(HttpClient::class, fn () => HttpClientBuilder::buildDefault());
```
