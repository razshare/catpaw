# Services

A class annotated with the _Service_ attribute is a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) which benefits from dependency injections.<br/>
Services themselves are injectable dependencies.


Services are the building blocks of _catpaw_, whenever possible, classes should be converted into services, requiring their dependencies through the ___construct_ method or [entry method](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw/blob/main/docs/5.entry.md).


The following are 2 bare services and a 3rd one requiring them.

```php
namespace App;

use CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceA {
    public function myMethod():bool {
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App;

use CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceB {
    public function myMethod():bool {
        // ...
    }
}
```

```php
namespace App;

use CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Service;

#[Service]
class ServiceC {
    public function _construct(
        private ServiceA $serviceA,
        private ServiceB $serviceB,
    ) {
    }

    public function doSomething():bool {
        if ($this->serviceA->myMethod()) {
            return $this->serviceB->myMethod();
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```
