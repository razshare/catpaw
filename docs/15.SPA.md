# SPA

The `catpaw-web` library ships with a [default 404 event handler](./3.WebPathNotFound.md) which will default to an `./index.html` file when a specific route or file is not found, effectively enabling and `SPA mode` for your application.<br/>

On top of this default behaviour, the library provides the `CatPaw\Web\Utilities\SPA` abstract class, which can be extended in order to expose states for your SPA.<br/>

On the client side, you can use `import { StatefulRoute } from '@catpaw'` in order to manage such state.

### StatefulRoute example

Server side:
```php
<?php

namespace App\Pages;

use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Path;
use CatPaw\Web\Utilities\SPA;

#[Path("/")]
class HomePage extends SPA {
    protected function setState(array $state, array &$session):void {
        $session['state'] = $state;
    }

    protected function getState(callable $id, array &$session): array {
        $session['state'] = [
            "clicks"  => 0,
            ...($session['state'] ?? [])
            
        ];
        return $session['state'];
    }
}
```

In `main.svelte`
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { StatefulRoute } from '@catpaw'
  import { HomePage, NotFoundPage } from '@pages'
  import { Route, Router } from 'svelte-routing'
</script>

<Router>
  <StatefulRoute path="/" component={HomePage} />
  <Route path="*" component={NotFoundPage} />
</Router>
```

In `@pages/HomePage`
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { Writable } from 'svelte/store'
  export let state: Writable<{
    clicks: number
  }>
</script>

<button
    class="btn"
    on:click={() => $state.clicks++}
>
    <span>Click me</span>
</button>
<br/>
clicks: {$state.clicks}
```

This will create a session for the user and update it each time they click the button and increase the counter.<br/>
Reloading the page will not lose the counter state, since it's saved on the server.<br/>
If you're using the default `SessionOperationInterface`, your sessions will be saved on disk automaticalle (in `./.sessions`), meaning your can even restart your server and users could still recover they counter state (as long as they don't clear their `session-id` cookie ofcourse).

# Lazy

Most of the time you don't want to update your whole state every time you make a change - hence you can update specific keys in your state by marking them as _lazy_ using the `CatPaw\Web\lazy` function.

These lazy properties can be managed through a `GET` and a `PUT` method  that are automatically exposed when creating the properties using the `lazy` function.

The `lazy` function will return a `CatPaw\Web\Utilities\Lazy` instance.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Pages;

use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Path;
use function CatPaw\Web\lazy;
use CatPaw\Web\Utilities\SPA;

#[Path("/")]
class HomePage extends SPA {
    protected function setState(array $state, array &$session):void {
        $session['state'] = $state;
    }

    protected function getState(callable $id, array &$session): array {
        $session['state'] = [
            "clicks" => lazy($id('clicks'), 0)->push($session['clicks'])->build(),
            ...($session['state'] ?? [])
            
        ];
        return $session['state'];
    }
}
```

Note that `$id(string $value):string` is responsible for creating a deterministic unique id for your property.<br/>
Note that `$id()` involves hashing your class name into the final string, meaning if you change your class name or namespace, the final id will also change.<br/>
You could also give your properties ids manually, that would also work.<br/>

The main state served to the SPA will contain metadata about the lazy properties, but not the properties themselves.<br/>
This metadata will inform the `StatefulRoute` component on how to reach and manage these actual properties.

All you have to change on the client side is change the type of your property from `number` to `Lazy<number>` and treat it as a normal `svelte store`.

You would change `@pages/HomePage` like this:
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import type { Writable } from 'svelte/store'
  export let state: Writable<{
    clicks: Lazy<number>
  }>
  const { clicks } = $state //destructing in order to be able to use the "$" syntax.
</script>

<button
    class="btn"
    on:click={() => $clicks++}
>
    <span>Click me</span>
</button>
<br/>
clicks: {$clicks}
```
