# Svelte SPA

During development you will be running both a Vite and a CatPaw server.<br/>
The Vite server will act as a proxy for your `/api/*` and `*:state` requests, redirecting them to the CatPaw server.<br/>

The Vite server is only needed in development and should never be used in production.

---

First off install your composer and npm dependencies with

```bash
composer update
```
and 

```bash
npm i
```
Following that, start your CatPaw server with
```bash
composer start
```
or
```bash
composer watch
```

and start your Vite server with

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will be viewing your web application through the Vite server which is bound to [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173/).<br/>
All your `/api/*` requests will hit your CatPaw server directly thanks to the Vite proxy.

### Build for production

You can build your project for production using
```
npm run build
```
then you can start your server in production by running
```bash
./start
```

### Note

Don't use the Vite server in production, build your project and run the CatPaw server.

# How to use

The `catpaw/spa` library provides the `CatPaw\Web\Utilities\SPA` abstract class, which can be extended in order to expose states for your SPA.<br/>

On the client side, you can use `import { StatefulRoute } from '@catpaw'` in order to manage such states.

### StatefulRoute example

Server side:
```php
namespace App\Pages;

use CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Path;
use function CatPaw\Web\lazy;
use CatPaw\Web\Utilities\SPA;

#[Path("/")]
class HomePage extends SPA {
    #[Entry]
    public function setup() {
        $this->state = [
            "clicks"   => 0,
        ];
    }
}
```

In `main.svelte`
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { StatefulRoute } from '@catpaw'
  import { HomePage, NotFoundPage } from '@pages'
  import { Route, Router } from 'svelte-routing'
</script>

<Router>
  <StatefulRoute path="/" component={HomePage} />
  <Route path="*" component={NotFoundPage} />
</Router>
```

In `@pages/HomePage`
```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { link, type Lazy } from '@catpaw'
  export let state: {
    clicks: Lazy
  }
  const clicks = link<number>(state.clicks)
</script>

<button
    class="btn"
    on:click={() => $clicks++}
>
    <span>Click me</span>
</button>
<br/>
clicks: {$clicks}
```

Clicking the button will update the counter both on the client and on the server.
