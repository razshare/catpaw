# File system routes

Before defining a web route through the file system you should pick a directory to scan.

You can do this by specifying the `routesFromFileSystem` property when starting the web server.
```php
function main(){
    \CatPaw\Web\WebServer::start( routesFromFileSystem: './your/directory' );
}
```
Now `your/directory` can define some routes.

# How to define a route

Create a file `[your/directory]/index.get.php`, this file should return a function.
```php
return function(){
    return "hello world";
};
```

- The resulting function can inject any of the dependencies that a normal web route handler would, including path parameters, sessions, produced and consumed content etc.<br/>
  That is because, under the hood, the resulting function is actually used to create a normal web route handler, which means that the OpenAPI service will detect these routes and automatically document them for you as if they were normal web route handlers.

- The file name should always end with the extension `.[METHOD].php` where `[METHOD]` is an http method.

- This way the scanner is able to infer the http method to use when exposing the function you're returning.

- The web route path will match the location of your file relative to `your/directory`, in this case `/`.

- The file name `index.[METHOD].php` is reserved.<br/>
  When the scanner finds the string `index` in the file name it will completely ignore it.<br/>
  The `[METHOD]` will not be ignored however.

This means that, in this case, the scanner will automatically pick up the function and use it to map a web route handler for `GET /`, which when called will return the string `hello world` as `text/plain`.

The equivalent web route handler definition would be:

```php
Route::get('/',function(){
    return "hello world";
});
```

Let's see another example:

File name is `[your/directory]/about/{username}/index.get.php`

```php
return fn(#[Param] string $username)=>"this is $username's about page.";
```

As you can see, this example is injecting a path parameter, that is because the infered web path in this case is `/about/{username}`, which makes the parameter `#[Param] string $username` a valid injection.

The equivalent web route handler definition would be:

```php
Route::get('/about/{username}',fn(#[Param] string $username)=>"this is $username's about page.");
```

# Other file names

You don't have to name all your files as `index.[METHOD].php`, although some may prefer to organize their routes that way.


Using any other name will automatically register the file name itself as part of the path.

So this file name is allowed `/about/{username}.get.php`<br/>
And it will match 

- `GET /about/user1`
- `GET /about/user2`
- `GET /about/user3`
- etc...

Even this is allowed: `/about/admin-{username}.get.php`<br/>
And it will match

- `GET /about/admin-user1`
- `GET /about/admin-user2`
- `GET /about/admin-user3`
- etc...

As long as the file system permits it and its a valid route name, it will be handled as a normal web route handler name (since it actually is, as mentioned before).

# Mandatory POST example

If you've read the previous guides, rconsuming the body of an incoming `POST` request might be obvious how to do, but nevertheless, here I go.

It works the same as any web route handler or controller, simply inject the request body using the `#[\CatPaw\Web\Attributes\Body]` attribute:

```php
return function(
    #[Body] string $body
){
    return 'received:'.$body;
}
```
Accepting only specific content types:

```php
return 
#[Consumes("application/json")]
function(
    #[Body] array $body
){
    return 'received:'.json_encode($body);
}
```

And obviously, all of this will be automatically documented by the OpenAPI service.
