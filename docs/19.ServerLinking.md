# Server Linking (TODO)

Server linking is an attempt to describe complex interactions between servers using a declarative dedicated language syntax.

The feature could become very useful in rest apis, but it could extend to raw socket management.

An example of what I'm currently thinking of implementing:

```bash
POST:/api/comment/create($body) -> {articleID:$article,commentID:$comment} -> {
    GET:/api/article/$article/sort-comments-asc,
    GET:/api/article/$article/notify-subscribers/new-comment/$comment,
}

```

This piece of code is describing what should happen when a user is creating a new comment on an article.

1. The comment is created and it returns 
    ```ts
    {
        articleID:mixed
        commentID:mixed
    }
    ```
1. I destruct the returning object into `$article` and `$comment` using
    ```ts
    {
        articleID:$article
        commentID:$comment
    }
    ```
    which will assing `articleID` to `$article` and `commentID` to `$comment`.<br/>
    This will avoid naming collisions.
1. The instruction then describes that, _in parallel_, the server should execute 
    - `GET:/api/article/$article/sort-comments-asc` to sort the comments in an asc manner.<br/>
      Maybe using a SQL view? Who knows, details are not important at this stage, details are implemented at a lower level.
    - `GET:/api/article/$article/notify-subscribers/new-comment/$comment` notify everyone that someone has published a comment on the article
