# Server Linking (TODO)

Server linking is an attempt to describe complex interactions between servers using a declarative dedicated language syntax.

The feature could become very useful in rest apis, but it could extend to raw socket management.

An example of what I'm currently thinking of implementing:

```bash
GET:/api/account/authenticate -> POST:/api/comment/create($body) {articleID:$article,commentID:$comment} -> {
    GET:/api/article/$article/sort-comments-asc,
    GET:/api/article/$article/notify-subscribers/new-comment/$comment,
}

```
