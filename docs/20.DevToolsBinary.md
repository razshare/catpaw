This feature requires the binary of `catpaw-dev-tools`, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw-dev-tools/releases).
<hr/>

The reason this program exists is to help you manage your product life cycle by allowing you to publish new tags, export common files to all projects your product depends on and offers a complete tag nuke option for clearing all (local and remote) git tags.

The available options are 3: `--sync`, `--export`, `--delete-all-tags`.


__--sync__<br/>
   Synchronize origin repository and local repository.<br/>
   It will always try to create a new tag with the given version and update all the dependencies related to your projects.<br/>
   This will also run `composer fix`, so make sure this composer script exists.
   
__--export__<br/>
   Copy all `exports` (check the `product.yml` file) to all the other `projects`.<br/>
   Each project can overwrite `exports` by using the `imports` property.

__--delete-all-tags__<br/>
   Delete all repository local and remote tags, useful when tag naming becomes chaotic and needs a reset.

---

More options will come in the future.

---

You __must__ specify a relative configuration `./product.yml` file.<br/>
An example of `./product.yml`:
```yaml
exports:
  - "bin"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".github"
  - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
  - "psalm.xml"
  - "build.yml"

master: catpaw-dev-tools

    imports:
      - "bin"

  catpaw-server-linking:

    version: 0.4.30
```

This configuration defines a master project called `catpaw-dev-tools` which is located in a directory called `../catpaw-dev-tools`.<br/>

> **Note**
> 
> The current directory of the binary should always match the master project's directory


The master project exports the following files to the other projects:

```yaml
exports:
  - "bin"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".github"
  - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
  - "psalm.xml"
  - "build.yml"
```

> **Note**
>
> By default each project `imports` everything the master project `exports`.
> 
> Each project can also statically specify what it should import from the master project by using the `imports` property.
> 
> As you can see the `catpaw-svelte-starter` project specifies the `imports` property.<br/>
> In this case `catpaw-svelte-starter` omits the `.vscode` directory and includes a new file called `some-other-file.txt`.
> 
> `imports` is not a subset of `exports`, it's an actual overwrite, so you're free to import whatever file you like.


## Usage examples

A few examples on how to use this binary.

### Delete all local and remote tags
```bash
php product.phar --delete-all-tags
```
This will delete all tags and releases.


### Export master files to the other projects
```bash
php product.phar --export
```
Will copy all fiels according the `exports` and `imports` definitions.

### Sync all repositories
```bash
php product.phar --sync
```
For each project this will...
1. run `composer fix`
1. fetch, pull, commit, push, try to create a new tag, push and then push tags

Once all of the above operations have completed for all projects, it will also run `composer update` for each project.

It may be necessary to run this option multiple times in order to synchronize everything properly due to repository webhooks latency.
