This feature requires the binary of `catpaw-dev-tools`, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw-dev-tools/releases).
<hr/>

The reason this program exists is to help you manage your product life cycle by allowing you to publish new tags, export common files to all projects your product depends on and offers a complete tag nuke option for clearing all (local and remote) git tags.

The available options are 3: `--syng`, `--export`, `--delete-all-tags`.


__--sync__<br/>
   Synchronize origin repository and local repository.
   It will always try to create a new tag with the given version and update all the catpaw dependencies using your `prefix`.<br/>
   This means all your libraries should use the same prefix, in this case it would be `catpaw`, which translates to `"catpaw/<project>": "<version>"` for composer.<br/>
   This will also run `composer fix`, so make sure this composer script exists.
   
__--export__<br/>
   Copy all `exports` (check the `product.yml` file) to all the other `projects`.<br/>
   Each project can overwrite the copied files using the `imports` property in `product.yml`.

__--delete-all-tags__<br/>
   Delete all repository local and remote tags, useful when tag naming becomes chaotic and needs a reset.

---

More options will come in the future.

You __must__ specify a relative configuration `./product.yml` file.<br/>
An example of `./product.yml`:
```yaml

master: dev-tools

prefix: catpaw

exports:
  - "bin"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".github"
  - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
  - "psalm.xml"
  - "build.yml"

projects:
  dev-tools:
    version: 0.4.28
  core:
    version: 0.4.28
  web:
    version: 0.4.28
  cli:
    version: 0.4.28
  examples:
    version: 0.4.28
  mysql:
    version: 0.4.28
  mysql-dbms:
    version: 0.4.28
  optional:
    version: 0.4.28
  queue:
    version: 0.4.28
  raspberrypi:
    version: 0.4.28
  starter:
    version: 0.4.28
  store:
    version: 0.4.28
  cui:
    version: 0.4.28
  spa:
    version: 0.4.28
  web-starter:
    version: 0.4.28
  svelte-starter:
    version: 0.4.28
    imports:
      - "bin"
      - ".github"
      - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
      - "psalm.xml"
      - "build.yml"
  server-linking:
    version: 0.4.28
```

This configuration defines a master project called `dev-tools` located in a directory called `catpaw-dev-tools`.<br/>
The master project exports the following files to the other projects:

```yaml
exports:
  - "bin"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".github"
  - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
  - "psalm.xml"
  - "build.yml"
```

The `prefix` also applies to all the other projects, so this means that, for example, the `core` project is located in a directory called `catpaw-core`.

## Note
As you can see the `svelte-starter` specifies a property `imports`.<br/>
This  `imports` property overwrites the `export` property from the root of the configuration, making it possible to exclude or  inlcude certains fails into the  `svelte-start` project from the `dev-dools` master project.<br/>
In this case the outcome would be that `svelte-starter` will not import the `.vscode` directory.

## Usage examples

A few examples on how to use this binary.

### Delete all local and remote tags
```bash
php product.php ---delete-all-tags
```
This will delete all tags and releases.


### Export master files to the other projects
```bash
php product.php ---export
```
Will copy all fiels according the `exports` and `imports` definitions.

### Sync all repositories
```bash
php product.php ---sync
```
For each project this will...
1. run `composer fix`
1. commit, pull, push and push tags

Once all of the above operations have completed for all projects, it will also run `composer update` for each project.

It may be necessary to run this option multiple times in order to synchronize everything properly due to repository webhooks latency.
