This feature requires the binary of `catpaw-dev-tools`, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw-dev-tools/releases).
<hr/>

The reason this program exists is to help you manage your product life cycle by allowing you to publish new tags, export common files to all projects your product depends on and offers a complete tag nuke option for clearing all (local and remote) git tags.

There are a few options available


__`--sync`__<br/>
   Synchronize origin repository and local repository.<br/>
   It will always try to create a new tag with the given version and update all the dependencies related to your projects.<br/>
   This will also run `composer fix`.
   
__`--export`__<br/>
   Copy all `exports` (check the `product.yml` file) to all the other `projects`.<br/>
   Each project can overwrite `exports` by using the `imports` property.

__`--build-config`__<br/>
   Genereate a default configuration file to use with `--build`.

__`--build`__<br/>
   Build your catpaw project.

__`--delete-all-tags`__<br/>
   Delete all repository local and remote tags, useful when tag naming becomes chaotic and needs a reset.

__`--execute-everywhere`__<br/>
   Execute a command in every project.

__`--execute-everywhere-parallel`__<br/>
   Execute a command in every project in parallel.

__`--start-web-server`__<br/>
   Start a catpaw server.<br/>
   Use the `webServer` property in the `product.yml` file to configure the web server.

__`--clear-cache`__<br/>
   Delete the `.product.cache` file.

__`--sql-transform`__<br/>
   Point to a `.sql` file or a directory of `.sql` files and generate their `.php` catpaw route counterpart.<br/>
   See `--sql-transform-generator`.

__`--sql-transform-generator`__<br/>
   This `.php` file will be used as a template for transforming the `.sql` files into `.php` files.

__`--extensions`__<br/>
   Edit your CatPaw extensions using Dialog.

More options will come in the future.

You __must__ specify a relative configuration `./product.yml` file.<br/>
An example of `./product.yml`:
```yaml
master: .

exports:
  - "bin"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".github"
  - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
  - "psalm.xml"
  - "build.yml"

projects:
  .:
    library: catpaw/dev-tools
    version: 0.4.35
  ../catpaw-core:
    library: catpaw/core
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-web:
    library: catpaw/web
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-cli:
    library: catpaw/cli
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-examples:
    library: catpaw/examples
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-mysql:
    library: catpaw/mysql
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-mysql-dbms:
    library: catpaw/mysql-dbms
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-optional:
    library: catpaw/optional
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-queue:
    library: catpaw/queue
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-raspberrypi:
    library: catpaw/raspberrypi
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-starter:
    library: catpaw/starter
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-store:
    library: catpaw/store
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-cui:
    library: catpaw/cui
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-spa:
    library: catpaw/spa
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-web-starter:
    library: catpaw/web-starter
    version: 0.4.30
  ../catpaw-svelte-starter:
    library: catpaw/svelte-starter
    version: 0.4.30
    imports:
      - "bin"
      - ".github"
      - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
      - "psalm.xml"
      - "build.yml"
```

This configuration defines a master located in a directory called `.` (current directory).<br/>


The master project exports the following files to the other projects:

```yaml
exports:
  - "bin"
  - ".vscode"
  - ".github"
  - ".php-cs-fixer.php"
  - "psalm.xml"
  - "build.yml"
```

> **Note**
>
> By default each project `imports` everything the master project `exports`.
> 
> Each project can also statically specify what it should import from the master project by using the `imports` property.
> 
> As you can see the `catpaw-svelte-starter` project specifies the `imports` property.<br/>
> In this case `catpaw-svelte-starter` omits the `.vscode` directory and includes a new file called `some-other-file.txt`.
> 
> `imports` is not a subset of `exports`, it's an actual overwrite, so you're free to import whatever file you like.



### `--sync`
```bash
php product.phar --sync
```
For each project this will...
1. run `composer fix`.
1. fetch, pull, commit, push, try to create a new tag, push and then push tags.
1. manipulate `composer.json` to bump up any known dependencies to the latest version.<br/>
  A `known dependency` is a dependency listed in your `product.yml` file<br/>
  Its name must match the `library` property.<br/>
  For example, the following project defines its library name as `catpaw/core` in `product.yml`:<br/>
    ```yaml
    ../catpaw-core:
      library: catpaw/core
      version: 0.4.30
    ```
    and `composer.json` would require the dependency like so:
    ```json
    "require": {
      "catpaw/core": "^0.4"
    }
    ```
    this makes it possible for the program to keep all your projects up to date.
<br/>

Once all of the above operations have completed for all projects, it will also run `composer update` for each project.

It may be necessary to run this option multiple times in order to synchronize everything properly due to composer repository syncing delay.


### `--export`
```bash
php product.phar --export
```
Will copy all files according to the `exports` and `imports` definitions.


### `--build-config`
```bash
php product.phar --build-config
```
This will create a `build.yml` file using some defaults which should work fine for most applications.

### `--build`
```bash
php product.phar --build="build.yml"
```
> **Note** you can omit the file name and the builder will automatically look for `"build.yml"` or `"build.yaml"`
> ```bash
> php product.phar --build
> ```
> 
> This will execute the build functionality using the `build.yml` configuration file.

A build configuration file should look like this:
```yaml
name: app
entry: ./src/main.php
libraries: ./src/lib
match: /^\.\/(src|vendor|resources|dist|bin)\/.*/
```

> **Note** Each property has a meaning.
> - `name` is the name of the final .phar bundle.<br/>
>    If this name doesn't end with `".phar"`, the builder will automatically append `".phar"` and the end of the name.
> - `entry` is the name of the catpaw entry file.<br/>
>   Usually the file that contains your `main` function.
> - `libraries` this is the catpaw library directory.<br/>
>   You still need to match the directory using `match` below.<br/>
>   This simply instructs the phar engine which libraries to bootstrap with.
> - `match` matcher regex.<br/>
>   This regex will be executed against all files in the current directory and subdirectories.<br/>
>   Anything matching this regex will be included in the final `.phar` file.


### `--delete-all-tags`
```bash
php product.phar --delete-all-tags
```
This will delete all tags and releases.

You can restrict the deletion to certain projects only by specifying the project name.

For example the following will delete all the tags and releases of the `./catpaw-web` project

```php
php product.phar --delete-all-tags --project="./catpaw-web"
```

### `--execute-everywhere`
```bash
php product.phar --execute-everywhere="ls"
```
This will execute `ls` in all projects.

### `--execute-everywhere-parallel`
```bash
php product.phar --execute-everywhere-parallel="ls"
```
This will execute `ls` in all projects in parallel, the output might not be ordered.

### `--start-web-server`
```bash
php product.phar --start-web-server
```
This will start the catpaw web server.<br/>
Use the `product.yml` file to configure it.

```yml
webServer:
  interfaces: 
    - 127.0.0.1:8080
  secureInterfaces:
  routesFromFileSystem:
    - ./resources/routes/
  webRoot:
    - ./resources/www/
  showStackTrace: false
  showExceptions: false
  redirectToSecure: false
  pemCertificates: 
  headers: 
    - x-custom-header: "hello world"
```

### `--clear-cache`
```sh
php product.phar --clear-cache
```

This will delete the `.product.cache` file, allowing the `--sync` command to force push tags.


### `--extensions`

You can use `--extensions` to edit CatPaw extensions in your local project.

In the future it will be possible to edit extensions across all projects in your product, for now, you will have to launch the program for each project you want to edit and to so by selecting the libraries by hand.


Make sure you have linux dialog installed.<br/>
if you don't, run 
```php
sudo apt install dialog
```

Launch the product cli with

```php
php product.phar --extensions
```
Then your terminal should look similar to this

The libraries on the left side are the available ones, while the libraries on the right side libraries already installed in your project.

__/w mouse__<br/>
Using your mouse, double click on the any library on the left column to move it to the right column and vice versa.

__/w keyboard__<br/>
Navigate the libraries list with your arrow key and press `space bar` to add or remove them.
