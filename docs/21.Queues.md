# Queues

A queue is a sequence of `callables` that will always execute in a FIFO (First In First Out) order.

Each queue has a unique key, or a name if you will.

Queues can overlap while executing, but callables within the queues themselves will never overlap.

The `CatPaw\Queue\Services\QueueService` provides 2 methods:

```php
/**
 * Queue a callable to run on a specific tag.
 * @param  string                   $tag
 * @param  callable                 $action
 * @throws InvalidArgumentException
 * @return \Amp\Promise<void>
 */
public function queue(string $tag, callable $action):\Amp\Promise;
```
```php
/**
 * Consume all available callables on all tags.
 * Will not execute a second time unless the previous execution has finished.
 * @return \Amp\Promise<void>
 */
public function consume():\Amp\Promise;
```

More methods will come in the future.

# Usage example

In the following example I'm executing 2 callables thar delayed by 5 and 2 seconds using different tags `A` and `B`.

 ```php
use CatPaw\Queue\Services\QueueService;

function main(QueueService $queue){
    $start = time();

    yield $queue->queue("tag-a",function(){
        yield delay(5000);
        echo 'a'.PHP_EOL;
    });

    yield $queue->queue("tag-b",function(){
        yield delay(2000);
        echo 'b'.PHP_EOL;
    });

    yield $queue->consume();
    
    $finish = time();
    $delta = $finish - $start;
    echo "$delta seconds have passed.".PHP_EOL;
}
 ```

The output will be
```bash
b
a
5 seconds have passed.
```

Now I'll queue the 2 callables using the same tag name.

```php
use CatPaw\Queue\Services\QueueService;

function main(QueueService $queue){
    $start = time();

    yield $queue->queue("my-tag", function(){
        yield delay(5000);
        echo 'a'.PHP_EOL;
    });

    yield $queue->queue("my-tag", function(){
        yield delay(2000);
        echo 'b'.PHP_EOL;
    });

    yield $queue->consume();

    $finish = time();
    $delta = $finish - $start;
    echo "$delta seconds have passed.".PHP_EOL;
}
```

The output will be
```bash
a
b
7 seconds have passed.
```
As you can see, since the 2 callables are queued on the same tag `"my-tag"`, they are executed in FIFO order.
