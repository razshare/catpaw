# Build

You can build your whole project into a single `.phar` file with
```sh
php -dphar.readonly=0 catpaw.phar --build
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the latest `catpaw.phar` program from the [releases page](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw/releases).

> [!NOTE]
> The `-dphar.readonly=0` option is required because the program needs permissions to write the `.phar` file.

## Configuration
The configuration file is a `build.yaml` file

```yaml
name: app
entry: ./src/main.php
libraries: ./src/lib
environment: ./env.yaml
info: false
match: /(^\.\/(\.build-cache|src|vendor|resources|bin)\/.*)|(\.\/env\.yaml)|(\.\/env\.yaml)/
```

- `name` is the output name of your bundle.\
  The program will append `.phar` to this name if not already specified in the configuration.
- `entry` the entry file of your application.\
  This is the file that contains your `main` function.
- `libraries` a list of directories, separated by `,`, that contain php services.\
  These services will be passed up to the dependency injection container.
- `environment` the environment file of your application, usually `env.yaml`.\
  This is the same file that you usually pass in when you run `composer dev:start -- --environment="env.yaml"`.\
  This environment file is not required and can be overwritten at runtime by simply passing in the option
  ```sh
  php app.phar --environment="./my-env.yaml"
  ```
- `info` reserved for future use
- `match` a regular expression matching all other files you want bundled in your `.phar` file.

> [!NOTE]
> You can specify `--build-config-init` and the program will autogenerate a default configuration file for you.\
> This default configuration is meant for generic catpaw applications but you can customize it to fit your own needs.

## Optimize

You can shake off all your dev dependencies and make the bundle smaller by passing `--build-optimize`.

```sh
php -dphar.readonly=0 ./build.phar --init-config --optimize
```
The following is the bundle of `catpaw` itself _without_ `--build-optimize`

And _with_ `--build-optimize`

> [!NOTE]
> More optimization features may come in the future.
