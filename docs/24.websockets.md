# Websocket

You can upgrade your response to a websocket response using `function CatPaw\Web\websocket`.

The signature of the function is as follows

```php
function websocket(Request $request, WebsocketClientHandler $handler): ResponseModifier;
```

It's not completely automatic as it requires the incoming `Request` as a dependency.

Other than that it's pretty straightforward

```php
use \Amp\Http\Server\Request;
use function \CatPaw\Web\websocket;

return fn(Request $request) => websocket(
    request: $request,
    handler: new class implements WebsocketClientHandler {
        public function handleClient(
            WebsocketClient $client,
            Request $request,
            Response $response,
        ): void {
            $client->sendText("welcome!");

            foreach ($client as $message) {
                echo $message.PHP_EOL;
            }
        }
    }
);
```
