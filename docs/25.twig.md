# Twig

You can render twig files and serve them to the client using _twig()_.

```php
namespace CatPaw\Web;
/**
 * Render twig a file.
 * @param  string            ...$name The absolute path to the twig file.
 * @return TwigRenderContext
 */
function twig(...$name);
```

## How to render

Create a twig file, for example under _src/api/view.twig_

```twig
{# @var name string #}
{# @var fileName string #}

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    hello {{ name }}, this is {{ fileName }} speaking!
</body>
</html>
```

Then create your route handler, for example in _src/api/get.php_

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Web\twig;
use function CatPaw\Web\asFilename;

return function(){
    return
        twig($fileName = asFileName(__DIR__, 'view.twig'))
        ->setProperty('name', 'world')
        ->setProperty('fileName', $fileName)
        ->render();
};
```

The _$fileName_ is not required to be absolute, however your application's _cwd_ (current working directory) is always at the root of the project, so passing _"./view.twig"_ as _$fileName_ won't work, unless you change your application's _cwd_ to _\_\_DIR___.

For that reason, the code above is using _asFileName()_ to properly join _\_\_DIR___ and _"view.twig"_ into an absolute path.

> [!NOTE]
> These files you're passing into _twig($fileName)_ are getting cached immediately the first time they're being rendered.\
> This means the first time they're being rendered they will be loaded from disk.\
> Subsequent rendering requests will read the file directly from memory.
