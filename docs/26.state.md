# State

You can create a reactive state by extending _State_.

## Usage

Create a class and extend _State_.

```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Core\State;

class User extends State {
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public int $age,
    ){}
}
```

Instantiate a new _User_ and pass a callback to _run()_

```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Core\State;

class User extends State {
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public int $age,
    ){}
}

$user = new User(
    name: 'Keanu',
    age: 30,
);

$user->run(function() use($user) {
    echo "Happy birthday $user->name!\n"
});
```

Now modify any of its properties to trigger the registered callback

```php
<?php
use CatPaw\Core\State;
use Revolt\EventLoop;

class User extends State {
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        public int $age,
    ){}
}

$user = new User(
    name: 'Keanu',
    age: 30,
);

$user->run(function() use($user) {
    echo "Happy birthday $user->name!\n"
});

EventLoop::delay(2, function() use($user) {
    $user->age++;
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> Only properties directly attached to the _State_ are reactive.\
> If you want to react to changes nested in the state, those nested properties will have to extend _State_ as well.\
> \
> There is currently no mechanism to automatically detect nested reactive state.\
> It may come in the future.
