# Native Gui

Tools to create native graphical user interfaces are available.

This library only provides some primitives necessary to do some experiments, it is not a properly organized library yet.\
All necessary primitives will be available in the future and organized into a coherent _"php-like"_ library and possible with some attribute helpers to create Guis in a declarative manner.

# Basic example


- First create a CatPaw project using the basic starter template
  ```sh
  composer create-project catpaw/starter starter && \
  cd starter
  ```
- If you've already got a project, remember to update your dependencies
  ```sh
  composer update
  ```
- Now you need to compile the native gui library.\
  Don't worry, it's written in Go and the process is easy.\
  The following will copy the gui library and build it into your `src/lib/gui` directory
  ```sh
  cp -fr vendor/catpaw/src/lib/Gui/lib src/lib/gui &&\
  cd gui &&\
  go build -o main.so -buildmode=c-shared main.go &&\
  cpp -P ./main.h ./main.static.h &&\
  cd ..
  ```
  __This step may become automatic in the future.__

Now all you have to do is use the library through [goffi](./28.goffi.md).

```php
use CatPaw\Gui\Contract;
use function CatPaw\Core\asFileName;
use function CatPaw\Core\error;
use function CatPaw\Core\goffi;

function main() {
    $lib = goffi(Contract::class, asFileName(__DIR__, './lib/gui/main.so'))->try($error);
    if ($error) {
        return error($error);
    }

    $window = $lib->appNewWindow();
    $theme  = $lib->materialNewTheme();
    while (true) {
        $resultNextEvent = $lib->windowNextEvent($window);
        $event           = $resultNextEvent->r0;
        $t               = $resultNextEvent->r1;

        if ($event >= 0 && 1 == $t) {
            $context = $lib->appNewContext($event);
            $title   = $lib->materialH1($theme, "Hello from CatPaw");
            $maroon  = $lib->colorRgba(127, 0, 0, 255);
            $lib->materialSetLabelColor($title, $maroon);
            $lib->materialSetLabelAlignment($title, LABEL_ALIGN_MIDDLE);
            $lib->materialLabelStyleDrawToContext($title, $context);
            $lib->submit($event, $context);
        }
    }
}
```
