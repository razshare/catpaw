# Native Gui

Tools to create native graphical user interfaces are available.


> [!CAUTION]
> This feature is experimental and is subject to changes.


This library only provides some primitives necessary to do some experiments, it is not a properly organized library yet.\
All necessary primitives will be available in the future and organized into a coherent _"php-like"_ library and possibly with some attribute helpers to create Guis in a declarative manner.

# Basic example

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is based on [goffi](./28.goffi.md),
> this means you will need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your machine.


- First create a CatPaw project using the basic starter template
  ```sh
  composer create-project catpaw/starter starter && \
  cd starter
  ```
- If you've already got a project, remember to update your dependencies
  ```sh
  composer update
  ```
- Now you need to compile the native gui library.\
  The following will copy the gui library and build it into your `src/lib/gui` directory
  ```sh
  cp -fr vendor/catpaw/catpaw/src/lib/Gui/lib src/lib/gui &&\
  pushd src/lib/gui &&\
  go build -o main.so -buildmode=c-shared main.go &&\
  cpp -P ./main.h ./main.static.h &&\
  popd
  ```
  It will take a while the first time you build it.
  __This step may become automatic in the future.__

Now all you have to do is use the library through [goffi](./28.goffi.md).

- Write the following program in your _src/main.php_ file.

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\asFileName;
use function CatPaw\Core\error;

use function CatPaw\Core\goffi;
use CatPaw\Gui\Contract;

use const CatPaw\Gui\LABEL_ALIGN_MIDDLE;
use const CatPaw\Gui\REF_CONTEXT;
use const CatPaw\Gui\REF_LABEL;
use const CatPaw\Gui\REF_RGBA;

function main() {
    $lib = goffi(Contract::class, asFileName(__DIR__, './lib/Gui/lib/main.so')->withPhar())->try($error);
    if ($error) {
        return error($error);
    }

    $black  = $lib->rgba(0, 0, 0, 255);
    $window = $lib->window();
    $theme  = $lib->theme();

    while (true) {
        $event = $lib->event($window);
        $t     = $event->r1;
        $event = $event->r0;

        if ($event < 0) {
            continue;
        }

        if (1 === $t) {
            $lib->reset();

            $context = $lib->context($event);
            $title   = $lib->h1($theme, "Hello from CatPaw");
            $maroon  = $lib->rgba(127, 0, 0, 255);

            $line = $lib->pathStart(220, 150);
            $lib->lineTo($line, 30, 70);
            $lib->arcTo($line, 100, 100, 200, 200, M_PI * 2);
            $lib->lineTo($line, 70, 30);
            $lib->pathEnd($line, 3, $black);

            $lib->labelSetColor($title, $maroon);
            $lib->labelSetAlignment($title, LABEL_ALIGN_MIDDLE);
            $lib->labelLayout($title, $context);
            $lib->draw($event);

            $lib->remove($context, REF_CONTEXT);
            $lib->remove($title, REF_LABEL);
            $lib->remove($maroon, REF_RGBA);
        } else if (2 === $t) {
            die();
        }
    }
}
```

- Run the program with
  ```sh
  composer prod:start
  ```

- Building to phar is also supported
  ```sh
  com prod:build &&\
  php app.phar
  ```

> Technically you could replace the 2 files an inject different code to execute.


The result will look something like this
