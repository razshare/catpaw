# Native Gui

Tools to create native graphical user interfaces are available.


> [!CAUTION]
> This feature is experimental and is subject to changes.


This library only provides some primitives necessary to do some experiments, it is not a properly organized library yet.\
All necessary primitives will be available in the future and organized into a coherent _"php-like"_ library and possibly with some attribute helpers to create Guis in a declarative manner.

# Basic example

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is based on [goffi](./28.goffi.md),
> this means you will need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your machine.


- First create a CatPaw project using the basic starter template
  ```sh
  composer create-project catpaw/starter starter && \
  cd starter
  ```
- If you've already got a project, remember to update your dependencies
  ```sh
  composer update
  ```
- Now you need to compile the native gui library.\
  Don't worry, it's written in Go and the process is easy.\
  The following will copy the gui library and build it into your `src/lib/gui` directory
  ```sh
  cp -fr vendor/catpaw/catpaw/src/lib/Gui/lib src/lib/gui &&\
  cd src/lib/gui &&\
  go build -o main.so -buildmode=c-shared main.go &&\
  cpp -P ./main.h ./main.static.h &&\
  cd ..
  ```
  It will take a while the first time you build it.
  __This step may become automatic in the future.__

Now all you have to do is use the library through [goffi](./28.goffi.md).

- Write the following program in your _src/main.php_ file.

```php
<?php
use function CatPaw\Core\error;
use function CatPaw\Core\goffi;
use CatPaw\Gui\Contract;
use const CatPaw\Gui\LABEL_ALIGN_MIDDLE;

function main() {
    $lib = goffi(Contract::class, './src/lib/gui/main.so')->try($error);
    if ($error) {
        return error($error);
    }

    $window = $lib->appNewWindow();
    $theme  = $lib->materialNewTheme();
    while (true) {
        $resultNextEvent = $lib->windowNextEvent($window);
        $event           = $resultNextEvent->r0;
        $t               = $resultNextEvent->r1;

        if ($event >= 0 && 1 == $t) {
            $context = $lib->appNewContext($event);
            $title   = $lib->materialH1($theme, "Hello from CatPaw");
            $maroon  = $lib->colorRgba(127, 0, 0, 255);
            $lib->materialSetLabelColor($title, $maroon);
            $lib->materialSetLabelAlignment($title, LABEL_ALIGN_MIDDLE);
            $lib->materialLabelStyleDrawToContext($title, $context);
            $lib->submit($event, $context);
        }
    }
}
```

- Run the program with
  ```sh
  composer prod:start
  ```

- Building to phar is also supported
  ```sh
  com prod:build &&\
  php app.phar
  ```

> This will dump the shared object and the header file to the current directory ans use them.\
> Technically you could replace the 2 files an inject different code to execute.
