# Web Path Not Found

Whenever an incoming request does not match any http event, by default, that request will fallback to the "404 Not
Found" event listener.

- The [catpaw/web](https://github.com/tncrazvan/catpaw-web) package ships with a default 404 event.
- You can overwrite this event.<br />
- There are 2 different ways to customize your 404 event.

## @404

You can listen for the "@404" event name.<br />

For example, you might want to return a custom message if a GET resource is not found:

```php
<?php

use CatPaw\Web\Server;

function main() {
  $server = Server::create();
  $server->router->get("@404",function(){
    return "Sorry, couldn't find the resource!";
  });
  $server->start();
}
```

<br />

## Router::notFound

The other way of doing this is by using the ```Router::notFound(array|Closure)```, this will listen for the ```@404```
event on all default methods.

```php
$server->router->notFound(function(){
    return "Sorry, couldn't find the resource!";
});
```

This is the equivalent of doing:

```php
$callback = fn()=>"Sorry, couldn't find the resource!";
$server->router->copy("@404",$callback);
$server->router->delete("@404",$callback);
$server->router->get("@404",$callback);
$server->router->head("@404",$callback);
$server->router->link("@404",$callback);
$server->router->lock("@404",$callback);
$server->router->options("@404",$callback);
$server->router->patch("@404",$callback);
$server->router->post("@404",$callback);
$server->router->propfind("@404",$callback);
$server->router->purge("@404",$callback);
$server->router->put("@404",$callback);
$server->router->unknown("@404",$callback);
$server->router->unlink("@404",$callback);
$server->router->unlock("@404",$callback);
$server->router->view("@404",$callback);
```
