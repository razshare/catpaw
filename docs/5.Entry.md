# Entry

Every time a dependency is injected by `catpaw-core` it will also run the first public method annotated with the `#[\Catpaw\Attributes\Entry]` attribute.


This entry method is optional and it differs from a constructor because it can return a promise, meaning that you can setup your instances using async operations and wait for them to finish.


The same thing can not be done by simply using a constructor, that is because constructors cannot return promises.

While it's true that you could use `\Amp\call` inside a constructor to run your async operations, without returning a proper promise it wouldn't be possible wait for the `\Amp\call` to finish its execution.


The following is an example how how the `#[\Catpaw\Entry]` attribute can be used.

 ```php
namespace App;

use CatPaw\Attributes\Entry;

class WeirdCat {

    private bool $itBarks

    /**
     * This method will run everytime this class is injected as a dependency.
     */
    #[Entry]
    public function setup(WeirdService $weirdService){
        $this->itBarks  = yield $weirdService->doesTheCatBark($this);    //imagine this method would be async
    }
}
 ```
