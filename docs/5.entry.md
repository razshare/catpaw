# Entry attribute

The `CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Entry` attribute is an attribute that can be attached to any public method of any injectable class, aka any `dependency`.

Every time a dependency is created, every public method annotated with the `#[Entry]` will be invoked with all its valid dependencies (parameters) resolved.


This entry method is optional, and it differs from a constructor because it can return `Unsafe`.

When it returns `Unsafe`, the dependency container (`CatPaw\Core\Container`) will pass the error along to its invoker, usually `Container::create`.


The same thing can not be done by simply using a constructor, that is because constructors cannot return anything else other than their own class.

 ```php
namespace App;

use CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Entry;
use CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Service;
use CatPaw\Core\Attributes\Singleton;
use CatPaw\Core\Unsafe;
use function CatPaw\Core\ok;

#[Singleton]
class TheWeirdCat {
    #[Entry] public function setup(WeirdCatService $service):Unsafe{
        $theCatBarks  = $service->doesTheCatBark();
        if($theCatBarks){
            return "This cat barks!";
        }
        return ok();
    }
}

#[Service]
class WeirdCatService {
    public function doesTheCatBark():bool{
        return true;
    }
}
 ```
