# Custom Attributes

1. An attribute is a class that's annotated with `#[Attribute]`.<br/>
2. Attributes alone won't interact with CatPaw by themselves, in order to enable that interaction the class must
  implement `CatPaw\Interfaces\AttributeInterface`.
3. The default `AttributeInterface` implementation is defined in the
  trait `CatPaw\Traits\CoreAttributeDefinition`.
4. Use any of the following extra interfaces to define special behaviour
   - `CatPaw\Interfaces\OnParameterMount`\
      offers the `::onParameterMount` method, which will trigger 
      before a parameter is about to be passed to a function or method.
     > **Note**\
     Usually used to resolve route handlers dependencies.\
     For example CatPaw itself uses this interface to inject `#[Param]` and `#[Query]` attributes.
   - `CatPaw\Interfaces\OnFunctionMount`\
     offers the `::onFunctionMount` method, which will trigger before a function is mounted into scope.\
     > **Note**\
     Currently the only type of functions that are "mounted in scope" are route handlers. 
   - `CatPaw\Interfaces\OnClassInstantiation`\
     offers the `::onClassInstantiation` method.
     This interface has currently no use case.\
     In the future the `::onClassInstantiation` method will trigger whenever the dependency container (`CatPaw\Container`) creates a new dependency (`CatPaw\Container::create`).
   - `\CatPaw\Web\Interfaces\OnRequest`\
     offers the `::onRequest` method, which will trigger before a route handler is executed.
   - `\CatPaw\Web\Interfaces\OnResult`\
     offers the `::onResult` method, which will trigger after a route handler is executed but before the result of the route handler is served.\
      This is useful for modifying a response, much like a middleware would do, but much more restricted.


Create the class, annotate it with `#[Attribute]` and implement `AttributeInterface`

```php
use function CatPaw\anyError;
use CatPaw\DependenciesOptions;
use CatPaw\Interfaces\AttributeInterface;
use CatPaw\Interfaces\OnParameterMount;
use function CatPaw\ok;
use CatPaw\Traits\CoreAttributeDefinition;
use CatPaw\Unsafe;
use CatPaw\Web\Server;

#[Attribute]
class HelloWorldAttribute implements AttributeInterface, OnParameterMount {
    use CoreAttributeDefinition;
    public function onParameterMount(ReflectionParameter $reflection, mixed &$value, DependenciesOptions $options) : Unsafe {
        $value = "hello world";
        return ok();
    }
}

function main(): Unsafe {
    return anyError(
        $server = Server::create(),
        $server->value->router->get(
            path: "/",
            callback: static fn (#[HelloWorldAttribute] string $greeting) => $greeting,
        ),
        $server->value->start()->await(),
    );
}
```

The above code defines an attribute called `#[HelloWorldAttribute]`, which triggers on parameter mount and sets the value of the parameter to `"hello world"`. 

> **Note**\
> When the parameter mounts, a new instance of the attribute will be created.
