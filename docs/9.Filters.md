# Filters

Filters will reject away or permit requests before they reach the actual event handler of your http endpoint.<br/>

A filter has every capability oh a [route handler](./1.RouteHandlers.md), meaning it can request dependencies and return a
response.<br/>

- Whenever a filter return `true` the request is permitted through and the next filter will process it, until it reaches
  the last callback, which is considered to be the **route handler**.
- Whenever a filter returns something other than `true`, the request is rejected with that return value.

Imagine that `validateToken(string $token):bool` is defined somewhere in the application:

```php
use CatPaw\Tools\Helpers\Route;
use CatPaw\Attributes\Http\Produces;
use CatPaw\Attributes\Http\RequestQuery;
use Amp\Http\Server\Response;
use Amp\Http\Status;

$filter = 
          fn(
              #[RequestQuery("token")] 
              false|string $token
          ) => validateToken($token??'')??new Response(Status::FORBIDDEN,[],"Invalid token.");

$handler =
          #[Produces("text/html")] 
          fn()=> "welcome!";

Route::get("/",[$filter,$handler]);
```

This configuration will reject any request that doesn't specify the `token` query string.
